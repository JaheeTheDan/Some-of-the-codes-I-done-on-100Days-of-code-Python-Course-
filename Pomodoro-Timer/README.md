# Pomodoro-Timer
A python script that time how long a person should work on a task andthen tell the person to take a break

According to Wikipedia, The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks (5â€“10 minutes) and long breaks (20 to 30 minutes). 

So the script would set a timer of 25 minutes for you do your task, and when the 25 minutes is up. The window will pop up and tell you take a 5 minute break. And at every 4th break, it would be 20 minutes break. This would repeat until the reset button is pressed or the script is exited.
